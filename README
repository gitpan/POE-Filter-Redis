NAME
    POE::Filter::Redis - A POE Filter for the Redis protocol

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      use POE::Filter::Redis;

      my $filter = POE::Filter::Redis->new();

      my $stream = $filter->put( [ [ 'SET', 'mykey', 'myvalue' ] ] );

      my $responses = $filter->get( [ "-NOT OK THIS TIME\x0D\x0A", "$6\x0D\x0Afoobar\x0D\x0A" ] );

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Filter::Redis is a POE::Filter for the Redis protocol,
    <http://redis.io/topics/protocol>.

    It is a "client" side implementation.

    It should be POE::Filter::Stackable friendly if you like that sort of
    thing.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "new"
        Creates a new POE::Filter::Redis object.

METHODS
    "get"
    "get_one_start"
    "get_one"
        Takes an arrayref which contains lines of Redis protocol streams
        from a Redis server. Returns arrayref of arrayrefs, each being a
        complete response from the server.

    "put"
        Takes an arrayref of arrayrefs. Each arrayref should contain an
        individual Redis command and any additional parameters. Returns an
        arrayref of protocol encoded strings suitable for sending over the
        wire to a Redis server.

    "get_pending"
        Returns any data remaining in a filter's input buffer

    "clone"
        Makes a copy of the filter, and clears the copy's buffer.

SEE ALSO
    Please see POE::Filter for documentation regarding the base interface.
